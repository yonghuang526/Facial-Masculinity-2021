# *Genetic and morphological estimates of androgen exposure predict social deficits in multiple neurodevelopmental disorder cohorts*

## What This Repo Contains

This repo contains code and summary data used to generate Figures 2-4 for the paper *Genetic and morphological estimates of androgen exposure predict social deficits in multiple neurodevelopmental disorder cohorts* and their accompanying statistics. 

The exact code used to generate the figures from the paper can be found in: 
* `devGenes_final_figures_code.R`
* `helper_functions.R`

The data can be found in: 
* `devGenes_final_factor_model_loadings.txt`
* `table_S1_final.txt`

Finally, a walkthrough of the code may be found in `Figures_2_3_4.pdf`

These figures and data relate only to the study’s DevGenes cohort, as raw data from the other cohort — SPARK – cannot be publicly released. SPARK data may be obtained by researchers approved by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, through SFARI Base: https://www.sfari.org/resource/sfari-base.
